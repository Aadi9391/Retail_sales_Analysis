Retail Sales Analysis 
Built a relational database and ingested a retail transactions dataset to support analytical queries. Cleaned data by identifying and removing records with missing or null values to ensure data integrity. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL aggregations, window functions, and conditional logic to derive insights.
Solved business-driven questions such as:
Sales breakdown by product category, Top customers by revenue, Monthly trends & best selling months, Customer demographics (age, gender), Transactions by time-of-day (morning, afternoon, evening), Presented findings and summaries highlighting sales patterns, customer behaviour, and category performance.
## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Findings

- **Customer Demographics**: The dataset includes customers from various age groups, with sales distributed across different categories such as Clothing and Beauty.
- **High-Value Transactions**: Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 1000, indicating premium purchases.
- **Sales Trends**: Monthly analysis shows variations in sales, helping identify peak seasons.
- **Customer Insights**: The analysis identifies the top-spending customers and the most popular product categories.

## Reports

- **Sales Summary**: A detailed report summarizing total sales, customer demographics, and category performance.
- **Trend Analysis**: Insights into sales trends across different months and shifts.
- **Customer Insights**: Reports on top customers and unique customer counts per category.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a comprehensive introduction to SQL for data analysts, covering database setup, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and business-driven SQL queries. The findings from this project can help drive business decisions by understanding sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.
